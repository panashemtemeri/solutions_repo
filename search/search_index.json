It is analyzed as two separate motions in horizontal and vertical directions. 1. Assumptions in Projectile Motion: The only force acting on the projectile (neglecting air resistance) is gravity \\(g = 9.81 \\, m/s^2\\) . The motion is independent in horizontal and vertical directions . The horizontal motion has constant velocity (no acceleration). The vertical motion has uniform acceleration due to gravity. 2. Equations of Motion: Let: \\(v_0\\) = initial velocity \\(\\theta\\) = launch angle \\(v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos\\theta\\) (initial horizontal velocity) \\(v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin\\theta\\) (initial vertical velocity) \\(g = 9.81 \\, m/s^2\\) (acceleration due to gravity) \\(t\\) = time \\(x\\) = horizontal displacement \\(y\\) = vertical displacement Horizontal Motion (Constant Velocity): $$ x = v_{0x} t = (v_0 \\cos\\theta) t $$ $$ v_x = v_0 \\cos\\theta $$ \\(\\Rightarrow\\) No acceleration in the horizontal direction. Vertical Motion (Accelerated Motion due to Gravity): $$ y = v_{0y} t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ $$ v_y = v_{0y} - g t $$ \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Velocity decreases until the projectile reaches the highest point, then increases downward. 3. Key Parameters in Projectile Motion: (a) Time of Flight (Total time the projectile remains in the air) $$ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} $$ derived from setting \\(y = 0\\) when the projectile lands (b) Maximum Height (Highest point reached by the projectile) $$ H = \\frac{(v_0 \\sin\\theta)^2}{2g} $$ (derived by setting \\(v_y = 0\\) at the peak) (c) Range (Total horizontal distance covered) $$ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} $$ $ This is maximized when $$ \\theta = 45^\\circ $ 4. Summary: The horizontal component remains constant \\(x = v_{0x} t\\) The vertical component follows free-fall motion under gravity \\(y = v_{0y} t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2\\) . The time of flight, maximum height, and range depend on the initial velocity and angle of projection. The trajectory is a symmetric parabola .

This relationship allows us to determine planetary motions and understand gravitational interactions on both local and cosmic scales. By analyzing this relationship, we can connect fundamental principles of gravity with real-world phenomena, such as satellite orbits and planetary systems. Task Derive the relationship between the square of the orbital period and the cube of the orbital radius for circular orbits. Discuss the implications of this relationship for astronomy, including its role in calculating planetary masses and distances. Analyze real-world examples, such as the Moon's orbit around Earth or the orbits of planets in the Solar System. Implement a computational model to simulate circular orbits and verify the relationship. Kepler\u2019s Third Law Kepler\u2019s Third Law states that for objects in circular orbits, the square of the orbital period ( \\(T\\) ) is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius ( \\(r\\) ): \\[ T^2 \\propto r^3 \\] This relationship can be derived using Newton\u2019s Law of Gravitation and the concept of centripetal force. The formula for the orbital period of an object in a circular orbit is: \\[ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{GM} \\] Where: - \\(T\\) is the orbital period (time taken for one complete orbit), - \\(r\\) is the orbital radius (average distance from the central body), - \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant ( \\(6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3 \\, \\text{kg}^{-1} \\, \\text{s}^{-2}\\) ), - \\(M\\) is the mass of the central body (such as the Sun, Earth, etc.). Implications for Astronomy Planetary Distances and Masses: Kepler\u2019s Third Law allows astronomers to calculate the distance of planets from their star (e.g., the distance of planets from the Sun in the Solar System). It also helps in determining the mass of celestial bodies. Satellite Orbits: Understanding how satellite orbits work and determining the time it takes for satellites to complete an orbit (orbital period). Exoplanet Detection: Kepler's Third Law is used in determining the characteristics of exoplanets orbiting distant stars. Real-World Examples Moon's Orbit Around Earth The Moon\u2019s orbit is a classic example where Kepler\u2019s Third Law holds true. By measuring the orbital period and radius of the Moon's orbit, we can confirm the relationship between these two quantities. Orbits of Planets in the Solar System The planets in the Solar System (e.g., Earth, Mars, Jupiter) all follow Kepler\u2019s Third Law. The orbital period increases as the orbital radius increases, with outer planets having longer orbital periods compared to inner planets. Graphical Analysis The Python script above generates a graph showing the relationship between \\( T^2 \\) (orbital period squared) and \\( r^3 \\) (orbital radius cubed). This confirms Kepler\u2019s Third Law , where the data points align, showing that the square of the orbital period is indeed proportional to the cube of the orbital radius. Discussion on Elliptical Orbits While Kepler\u2019s Third Law applies directly to circular orbits, it can be extended to elliptical orbits.

The formula for escape velocity \\(v_2\\) is: \\[ v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}} \\] Where the variables have the same meaning as above. Escape velocity is always higher than the orbital velocity because it accounts for the additional energy needed to break free from the gravitational pull. 1.3 Third Cosmic Velocity (Solar Escape Velocity) This is the velocity required for an object to escape the gravitational influence of the entire solar system, i.e., to leave the Sun\u2019s gravity.

We'll implement a Python script to calculate and visualize the trajectory of the payload under Earth's gravity, accounting for initial conditions such as position, velocity, and altitude. This will allow us to examine the possible paths of the payload (e.g., parabolic, hyperbolic, elliptical) and relate the results to real-world space missions. 1.

Initial Conditions and Numerical Method The initial conditions for the payload include: Initial position (in meters, relative to Earth's center), Initial velocity (in meters per second), Initial altitude (the height above Earth's surface). Using numerical methods like Runge-Kutta, we can compute the trajectory over time. Example Simulation Explanation: Initial Conditions: We set the initial altitude as 500 km above Earth's surface. The initial velocity is set tangentially (10,000 m/s). Equations of Motion: We use polar coordinates for the trajectory: - $ r $ (radial distance), - $ \\theta $ (angle), - $ v_r $ (radial velocity), and - $ v_\\theta $ (tangential velocity). Numerical Integration: We solve the system of differential equations using scipy.integrate.solve_ivp . Plotting: The trajectory is plotted in Cartesian coordinates (x, y) after converting from polar coordinates. The Earth\u2019s position is marked as a red point at the origin. Saving the Plot: The plot is saved as payload_trajectory.png . 4. Discussion of Trajectories The trajectory can be parabolic, elliptical, or hyperbolic based on the initial velocity. If the velocity is below escape velocity, the trajectory will be elliptical (bounded orbit). If the velocity is exactly equal to escape velocity, the trajectory will be parabolic. If the velocity exceeds escape velocity, the trajectory will be hyperbolic (unbounded). The above simulation assumes the payload has tangential velocity, which might lead to an elliptical or parabolic orbit depending on the speed. 5.

Reentry : Simulating the trajectory after the payload is released from a spacecraft can help design reentry trajectories.

On a water surface, this phenomenon can be easily observed when ripples from different points meet, forming distinctive interference patterns.

It also allows us to explore important concepts like the relationship between wave phase and the effects of multiple sources. This task offers a hands-on approach to learning about wave interactions and their real-world applications, making it an interesting and engaging way to dive into wave physics. Task A circular wave on the water surface, emanating from a point source located at position \\(\\mathbf{r_0}\\) , can be described by the Single Disturbance equation: \\[ \\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t) = A \\cos(k|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r_0}| - \\omega t + \\phi_0) \\] where: - \\(\\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t)\\) is the displacement of the water surface at point \\(\\mathbf{r}\\) and time \\(t\\) , - \\(A\\) is the amplitude of the wave, - \\(k\\) is the wave number, related to the wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) , - \\(\\omega\\) is the angular frequency, related to the frequency \\(f\\) , - \\(|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r_0}|\\) is the distance from the source to the point \\(\\mathbf{r}\\) , - \\(\\phi_0\\) is the initial phase.

Simulations provide an intuitive and hands-on way to observe this phenomenon in action. Task: 1. Simulating Sampling Distributions: Select several types of population distributions, such as: Uniform Distribution: All values within a given range are equally likely. Exponential Distribution: Describes the time between events in a Poisson process (events occurring continuously and independently at a constant average rate). Binomial Distribution: Represents the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (each trial has only two possible outcomes: success or failure). For each distribution, generate a large dataset representing the population. Examples: Population distributions Sampling and Visualization: Randomly sample data from the population and calculate the sample mean for different sample sizes (e.g., 5, 10, 30, 50). Repeat the process multiple times to create a sampling distribution of the sample mean. Plot histograms of the sample means for each sample size and observe the convergence to a normal distribution. Formulas: Sample Mean ( \\(\\bar{x}\\) ): \\( \\(\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}\\) \\) where \\(x_i\\) are the individual data points in the sample and \\(n\\) is the sample size. Examples: Parameter Exploration: Investigate how the shape of the original distribution and the sample size influence the rate of convergence to normality. Highlight the impact of the population's variance on the spread of the sampling distribution. Observations: Shape of Original Distribution: Distributions closer to normal tend to have sampling distributions of the mean converge to normality faster with smaller sample sizes. Highly skewed distributions (like the exponential) may require larger sample sizes for the sampling distribution of the mean to appear approximately normal. Sample Size: As the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the mean becomes more and more bell-shaped (normal), regardless of the original population distribution. The spread of the sampling distribution also decreases with increasing sample size. Population Variance ( \\(\\sigma^2\\) ): The variance of the sampling distribution of the mean ( \\(\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}^2\\) ) is related to the population variance by the formula: \\( \\(\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\) \\) where \\(n\\) is the sample size.

Highly skewed distributions (like the exponential) may require larger sample sizes for the sampling distribution of the mean to appear approximately normal.

This problem connects fundamental concepts of probability, geometry, and numerical computation. It also provides a gateway to understanding how randomness can be harnessed to solve complex problems in physics, finance, and computer science. The Monte Carlo approach to \\(\\pi\\) estimation highlights the versatility and simplicity of this method while offering practical insights into convergence rates and computational efficiency. Task PART 1: ESTIMATING \\(\\pi\\) USING A CIRCLE 1. Theoretical Foundation: Consider a unit circle (radius \\(r=1\\) ) inscribed within a square with side length \\(s=2\\) . The area of the circle is \\(A_{circle} = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (1)^2 = \\pi\\) . The area of the square is \\(A_{square} = s^2 = 2^2 = 4\\) . If we randomly generate points uniformly within the square, the probability that a point falls inside the circle is the ratio of the circle's area to the square's area: \\[P(\\text{point inside circle}) = \\frac{A_{circle}}{A_{square}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\] Therefore, if we generate a large number of random points ( \\(N\\) ) within the square and count the number of points that fall inside the circle ( \\(N_{inside}\\) ), the ratio \\(\\frac{N_{inside}}{N}\\) will approximate this probability. We can then estimate \\(\\pi\\) as: \\[\\frac{N_{inside}}{N} \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\] Derivation of the formula for a unit circle: \\[\\pi \\approx 4 \\times \\frac{N_{inside}}{N}\\] Example: Imagine you throw darts randomly at a square board with a circle drawn inside it. If you throw many darts, the proportion of darts landing inside the circle compared to the total number of darts thrown will give you an idea of the ratio of their areas, which can then be used to estimate \\(\\pi\\) . 2. Simulation: Generate random points in a 2D square bounding a unit circle. Count the number of points falling inside the circle. Estimate \\(\\pi\\) based on the ratio of points inside the circle to the total points. Example Visualization: Create a plot showing the randomly generated points, distinguishing those inside and outside the circle. Example Analysis: Investigate how the accuracy of the estimate improves as the number of points increases. Discuss the convergence rate and computational considerations for this method. Example - Convergence Analysis: Discussion: As the number of randomly generated points increases, the estimated value of \\(\\pi\\) tends to get closer to the true value. However, the convergence rate of Monte Carlo methods is typically slow, often proportional to \\(1/\\sqrt{N}\\) , where \\(N\\) is the number of samples.

Simulation:"},{"location":"1%20Physics/7%20Measurements/Problem_1/","text":"Measurements Problem 1: Measuring Earth's Gravitational Acceleration with a Pendulum Motivation: The acceleration ( \\(g\\) ) due to gravity is a fundamental constant that influences a wide range of physical phenomena. Measuring \\(g\\) accurately is crucial for understanding gravitational interactions, designing structures, and conducting experiments in various fields. One classic method for determining \\(g\\) is through the oscillations of a simple pendulum, where the period of oscillation depends on the local gravitational field. Task: Measure the acceleration \\(g\\) due to gravity using a pendulum and in detail analyze the uncertainties in the measurements. This exercise emphasizes rigorous measurement practices, uncertainty analysis, and their role in experimental physics. Procedure: 1. Materials: A string (1 or 1.5 meters long). A small weight (e.g., bag of coins, bag of sugar, key chain) mounted on the string. Stopwatch (or smartphone timer) with a precision of at least 0.01 seconds. Ruler or measuring tape with a resolution of 1 millimeter (0.001 meters). 2. Setup: Attach the weight securely to one end of the string. Fix the other end of the string to a sturdy support, ensuring the pendulum can swing freely. Measure the length of the pendulum ( \\(L\\) ) from the suspension point to the center of the weight using the ruler or measuring tape. Record the length \\(L\\) and the resolution of the measuring tool ( \\(\\Delta L_{res} = 0.001\\) m). Calculate the uncertainty in the length measurement ( \\(\\delta L\\) ) as half the resolution: \\( \\(\\delta L = \\frac{\\Delta L_{res}}{2} = \\frac{0.001 \\text{ m}}{2} = 0.0005 \\text{ m}\\) \\) Example (Recording Length): Data Collection: Displace the pendulum slightly (less than 15 degrees from the vertical) and release it gently to ensure smooth oscillations. Measure the time for 10 full oscillations ( \\(t_{10}\\) ). A \"full oscillation\" is one complete back-and-forth swing. Repeat this measurement 10 times. Record all 10 measurements of \\(t_{10}\\) . Example (Simulating Time Measurements): Calculations: Calculate the period: The period of one oscillation ( \\(T\\) ) is the mean time for 10 oscillations divided by 10: \\[T = \\frac{\\langle t_{10} \\rangle}{10}\\] The uncertainty in the period ( \\(\\delta T\\) ) is the uncertainty in the mean time for 10 oscillations divided by 10: \\[\\delta T = \\frac{\\delta \\langle t_{10} \\rangle}{10}\\] Example (Calculating Period and its Uncertainty): Determine \\(g\\) : The period of a simple pendulum is given by the formula: \\[T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}}\\] Solving for \\(g\\) , we get: \\[g = \\frac{4\\pi^2 L}{T^2}\\] Example (Calculating g): Propagate uncertainties: To find the uncertainty in \\(g\\) ( \\(\\delta g\\) ), we need to propagate the uncertainties in \\(L\\) ( \\(\\delta L\\) ) and \\(T\\) ( \\(\\delta T\\) ). Using the formula for \\(g\\) , we can use the following approximation for the relative uncertainty: \\[\\frac{\\delta g}{g} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\delta L}{L}\\right)^2 + \\left(2 \\frac{\\delta T}{T}\\right)^2}\\] Therefore, the absolute uncertainty in \\(g\\) is: \\[\\delta g = g \\times \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\delta L}{L}\\right)^2 + \\left(2 \\frac{\\delta T}{T}\\right)^2}\\] Example (Propagating Uncertainties): Analysis: Compare your measured \\(g\\) with the standard value ( \\(9.81 , \\text{m/s}^2\\) ). Calculate the percentage difference between your measured value and the standard value: \\[\\text{Percentage Difference} = \\left| \\frac{g_{measured} - g_{standard}}{g_{standard}} \\right| \\times 100%\\] Consider if your measured value, within its uncertainty ( \\(\\pm \\delta g\\) ), overlaps with the standard value. Discuss: The effect of measurement resolution on \\(g\\) : How did the resolution of your ruler and stopwatch limit the precision of your measurements of \\(L\\) and \\(t_{10}\\) , and consequently, the uncertainty in your calculated \\(g\\) ? A lower resolution would lead to larger initial uncertainties ( \\(\\delta L\\) and the resolution of the stopwatch), which would propagate to a larger \\(\\delta g\\) . Variability in timing and its impact on \\(g\\) : What were the sources of variability in your timing measurements? Human reaction time, slight variations in the release of the pendulum, and air resistance could contribute to the spread in your \\(t_{10}\\) measurements, reflected in the standard deviation and \\(\\delta \\langle t_{10} \\rangle\\) , ultimately affecting \\(\\delta g\\) . Taking more measurements can help reduce the uncertainty due to random timing variations. Any assumptions or experimental limitations: What assumptions did you make during the experiment? For example, the assumption of a simple pendulum (massless string, point mass), small angle oscillations ( \\(\\theta < 15^\\circ\\) ), and negligible air resistance. How might these assumptions have affected your results? Deviations from these ideal conditions would introduce systematic errors that are not accounted for in the uncertainty propagation based on measurement precision alone. For instance, a heavier string or larger oscillations would affect the period.

(Your detailed discussion here, addressing the points raised in the \"Analysis\" section.) For example: \"The resolution of the meter stick used to measure the pendulum length was 1 millimeter, resulting in an initial uncertainty of \\(\\pm 0.5\\) millimeters ( \\(\\pm 0.0005\\) m) in \\(L\\) . This uncertainty propagates to the final value of \\(g\\) . Similarly, the stopwatch had a precision of 0.01 seconds, which contributes to the uncertainty in the timing measurements. The standard deviation of our 10 time measurements reflects the random errors in our timing, likely due to human reaction time and slight variations in the pendulum's swing. The uncertainty in the mean time was calculated to be smaller than the standard deviation, as expected for multiple measurements. The calculated value of \\(g\\) was \\(9.74 \\pm 0.04 , \\text{m/s}^2\\) , which is slightly lower than the standard value of \\(9.81 , \\text{m/s}^2\\) . The percentage difference is approximately 0.7%. The uncertainty range of our measurement ( \\(9.70 , \\text{m/s}^2\\) to \\(9.78 , \\text{m/s}^2\\) ) does not fully encompass the standard value, suggesting potential systematic errors or underestimated uncertainties. Assumptions made during the experiment include that the pendulum behaves as a simple pendulum with a point mass and a massless string, and that the oscillations are small ( \\(< 15^\\circ\\) ). Deviations from these assumptions could introduce systematic errors. For instance, the weight used has a physical size, not a point mass, and the string has some mass, both of which can slightly affect the period. Air resistance, although likely small for our setup, could also have a minor effect. Future experiments could aim to minimize these effects by using a denser, smaller weight and conducting the experiment in a vacuum.

Task: Measure the acceleration \\(g\\) due to gravity using a pendulum and in detail analyze the uncertainties in the measurements.

Fix the other end of the string to a sturdy support, ensuring the pendulum can swing freely. Measure the length of the pendulum ( \\(L\\) ) from the suspension point to the center of the weight using the ruler or measuring tape. Record the length \\(L\\) and the resolution of the measuring tool ( \\(\\Delta L_{res} = 0.001\\) m). Calculate the uncertainty in the length measurement ( \\(\\delta L\\) ) as half the resolution: \\( \\(\\delta L = \\frac{\\Delta L_{res}}{2} = \\frac{0.001 \\text{ m}}{2} = 0.0005 \\text{ m}\\) \\) Example (Recording Length): Data Collection: Displace the pendulum slightly (less than 15 degrees from the vertical) and release it gently to ensure smooth oscillations. Measure the time for 10 full oscillations ( \\(t_{10}\\) ). A \"full oscillation\" is one complete back-and-forth swing. Repeat this measurement 10 times. Record all 10 measurements of \\(t_{10}\\) . Example (Simulating Time Measurements): Calculations: Calculate the period: The period of one oscillation ( \\(T\\) ) is the mean time for 10 oscillations divided by 10: \\[T = \\frac{\\langle t_{10} \\rangle}{10}\\] The uncertainty in the period ( \\(\\delta T\\) ) is the uncertainty in the mean time for 10 oscillations divided by 10: \\[\\delta T = \\frac{\\delta \\langle t_{10} \\rangle}{10}\\] Example (Calculating Period and its Uncertainty): Determine \\(g\\) : The period of a simple pendulum is given by the formula: \\[T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}}\\] Solving for \\(g\\) , we get: \\[g = \\frac{4\\pi^2 L}{T^2}\\] Example (Calculating g): Propagate uncertainties: To find the uncertainty in \\(g\\) ( \\(\\delta g\\) ), we need to propagate the uncertainties in \\(L\\) ( \\(\\delta L\\) ) and \\(T\\) ( \\(\\delta T\\) ). Using the formula for \\(g\\) , we can use the following approximation for the relative uncertainty: \\[\\frac{\\delta g}{g} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\delta L}{L}\\right)^2 + \\left(2 \\frac{\\delta T}{T}\\right)^2}\\] Therefore, the absolute uncertainty in \\(g\\) is: \\[\\delta g = g \\times \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\delta L}{L}\\right)^2 + \\left(2 \\frac{\\delta T}{T}\\right)^2}\\] Example (Propagating Uncertainties): Analysis: Compare your measured \\(g\\) with the standard value ( \\(9.81 , \\text{m/s}^2\\) ). Calculate the percentage difference between your measured value and the standard value: \\[\\text{Percentage Difference} = \\left| \\frac{g_{measured} - g_{standard}}{g_{standard}} \\right| \\times 100%\\] Consider if your measured value, within its uncertainty ( \\(\\pm \\delta g\\) ), overlaps with the standard value. Discuss: The effect of measurement resolution on \\(g\\) : How did the resolution of your ruler and stopwatch limit the precision of your measurements of \\(L\\) and \\(t_{10}\\) , and consequently, the uncertainty in your calculated \\(g\\) ? A lower resolution would lead to larger initial uncertainties ( \\(\\delta L\\) and the resolution of the stopwatch), which would propagate to a larger \\(\\delta g\\) . Variability in timing and its impact on \\(g\\) : What were the sources of variability in your timing measurements? Human reaction time, slight variations in the release of the pendulum, and air resistance could contribute to the spread in your \\(t_{10}\\) measurements, reflected in the standard deviation and \\(\\delta \\langle t_{10} \\rangle\\) , ultimately affecting \\(\\delta g\\) . Taking more measurements can help reduce the uncertainty due to random timing variations. Any assumptions or experimental limitations: What assumptions did you make during the experiment? For example, the assumption of a simple pendulum (massless string, point mass), small angle oscillations ( \\(\\theta < 15^\\circ\\) ), and negligible air resistance. How might these assumptions have affected your results? Deviations from these ideal conditions would introduce systematic errors that are not accounted for in the uncertainty propagation based on measurement precision alone. For instance, a heavier string or larger oscillations would affect the period.

(Your detailed discussion here, addressing the points raised in the \"Analysis\" section.) For example: \"The resolution of the meter stick used to measure the pendulum length was 1 millimeter, resulting in an initial uncertainty of \\(\\pm 0.5\\) millimeters ( \\(\\pm 0.0005\\) m) in \\(L\\) . This uncertainty propagates to the final value of \\(g\\) . Similarly, the stopwatch had a precision of 0.01 seconds, which contributes to the uncertainty in the timing measurements. The standard deviation of our 10 time measurements reflects the random errors in our timing, likely due to human reaction time and slight variations in the pendulum's swing. The uncertainty in the mean time was calculated to be smaller than the standard deviation, as expected for multiple measurements. The calculated value of \\(g\\) was \\(9.74 \\pm 0.04 , \\text{m/s}^2\\) , which is slightly lower than the standard value of \\(9.81 , \\text{m/s}^2\\) . The percentage difference is approximately 0.7%. The uncertainty range of our measurement ( \\(9.70 , \\text{m/s}^2\\) to \\(9.78 , \\text{m/s}^2\\) ) does not fully encompass the standard value, suggesting potential systematic errors or underestimated uncertainties. Assumptions made during the experiment include that the pendulum behaves as a simple pendulum with a point mass and a massless string, and that the oscillations are small ( \\(< 15^\\circ\\) ). Deviations from these assumptions could introduce systematic errors. For instance, the weight used has a physical size, not a point mass, and the string has some mass, both of which can slightly affect the period. Air resistance, although likely small for our setup, could also have a minor effect. Future experiments could aim to minimize these effects by using a denser, smaller weight and conducting the experiment in a vacuum. Increasing the number of timing measurements could further reduce the random error component of the uncertainty.\"","title":"2.
